SignToLearn is an application working with the Microsoft Kinect camera to teach users the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet. The user will have to sign letters as instructed by SignToLearn at defined intervals. Data gathered by the Kinect camera would check the users accuracy.

The repository for SignToLearn can be viewed at: https://github.com/siracoj/signtolearn

To run the application, clone the repository, plugin your Windows Kinect(Near
mode enabled), and run the "SignToLearn" Shortcut.

Video demonstrations of signs are contained in the training videos folder.

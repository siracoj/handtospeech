OBJECTIVE
To create an application that can translate the American Sign-Language (ASL) alphabet into text. 

VALUE PROPOSITION
Users unable to communicate through vocal speech, such as the mute and/or deaf, will be able to use this application to communicate to blind users or users who do not understand ASL. This communication will be through letter hand signs catptured in defined intervals.
This project will be interdisciplinary. Both Jared and Garrett will be using their programming knowledge to develop the application which will utilize the built-in APIs of the XBox Kinect to read the hand signals of users. Jared has a background in machine learning and will develop the system that translates the hand signals of users to text. Chou's background in database and interface design will be used to implement an intuitive interface for the application and fast queries to an efficient database of ASL to English translations. 

COMMUNICATION PLAN
Our team is using a Facebook group for general communication and notifications while using GitHub for sharing code and editing group files/submissions. GitHub also offers a Wiki page where the documentation can be stored, and an issues page where current bugs can be communicated
